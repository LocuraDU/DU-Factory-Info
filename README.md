:heavy_exclamation_mark: | If you are hooking the script to "HUB's" that came from a blueprint you will need to uncheck "AutoContainer" mode as there is a bug on dynamic properties from HUBs that are placed from blueprints. It seems not related to Lua but to element dynamic property. I will share it to server guys - NQ-Ligo

> **Warning**
> Too many screen in an area will hurt game performance. The game will also start throttling back screen quality upon reaching a certain number of screens. Using Animations in screens will make this much worse. Only use a few animated screens in an area for best performance.
